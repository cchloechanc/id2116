              <li>Based on our analysis (as shown in the table above), we came up with the concept of having an image being the feedback when a single bubble pops. We felt that it was unexpected and interesting feedback: multiple images revealed when multiple bubbles pop as they hit a wall.</li>

            <p class="mb-4">This week we focused on prototyping our concept out to test its feasibility.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>As we were trying to prototype with a bubble popping to reveal an image, we realised that the contact of a single bubble popping against the wall was not strong enough for the microbit to sense.</li>
              <li>Hence, we decided to switch our direction to having musical notes being played corresponding to the part of the wall as multiple bubbles pop against it. This will hopefully help the microbit to sense the popping of the bubbles more, as it is likely that when more bubbles pop at the same time, the contact would be stronger.</li>

              <li>Eventually, we came up with the concept of having the bubbles act as oxygen supplies, resuscitating, and finally helping the person (in the video) to swim out of the waters, and pop out from the screen (and tank).</li>

            <ul>
              <li>We started out by testing to see if the bubble can be sensed by microbit when it touches copper tape. However, using this method resulting in a lot of difficulties: The copper tape would often get very wet and soggy. The detection was often very unstable. </li>

              <li>So we decided to ask for some help, and after consultation, we decided to simplify our prototype, and to change our trigger point to the point where we click the button. (Once the button is clicked, the video will play)</li>
              <li>So, we modified our plan and this is the final one:</li>

              <li>We also decided to increase difficulty by doing the things below: 
                Adding a “finale” visual as well as music at the end of the interaction for when the user has finished “saving” the person in the video.
                Setting a range of motion for the trigger to work - beyond this range, the video will not play. We set the range of motion by calibrating the arc of fire.
                Syncing the video such that when the trigger is released, the “dropping down” video will play and the person in the video will fall from the same point. This was done by using conditionals.  
                Lastly, adding a confetti popper at the end of the video - a servo will pull the string of the confetti popper when it reaches the end of the video. We did this by linking the servo up with microbit.</li>

              <li>Here is the final test run of everything before the actual set-up of the prototype:</li>

              <li>However, during our final check, our microbit got fried (got really hot) and this unfortunately affected our final presentation.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>For the actual presentation day, we mounted the microbit to the bubble gun and set up the servo as such:</li>
              <img src="images/mp01/week 7.png" alt="Image" class="img-fluid" style="height:20em">
              <li>Everything was working at the start, however, as our microbit was fried from our previous testrun and our servo stopped working after a few tries (so we only managed to get our confetti popper to pop for a few times). So, we removed our servo from the setup (but explained it to our friends.) and let them interact using the bubble gun and the video.</li>
              <li>After reviewing the SUS evaluation, we feel that there was one area of improvement for us: the complexity of the system. Our system was not working for some parts, and there were a few times where we needed to be there to fix it.</li>
              <li>Overall, we still think that it was pretty good and everything was relatively smooth, especially when everything was working!</li>
