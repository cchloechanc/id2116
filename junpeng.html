   <p>Passionate about taking tangible steps in tackling real-world issues through entrepreneurship and innovation. I strongly believe in the construction of a better world by design and aspire to make use of my academic background in Industrial Design to create products, systems and experiences that make a positive difference. Always excited about self-improvement and engaging in new enriching experiences.</p>

   <h2>My strengths as a designer are...</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I am an idea person. The endless possibilities of the future - good or bad - excite me. As a designer, I developed an affinity to see problems as opportunities when tackling real world issues.</li>
      <li>Resourcefulness. In order to experiment with ideas quickly and efficiently as a designer, it is important and essential to be resourceful.</li>
      <li>As a designer, empathy is an important attribute that allows us to relate to the different stakeholders in any situation.</li>
      <li>I am efficient too.<li>
    </ul>
