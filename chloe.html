       <h1>Hi! My name is Chloe and I am a Year 2 student studying Industrial Design. I have a pet Bichon Frise named Munchie, who is really the only reason why I have friends. Apart from Munchie, I really love eating, sleeping, baking and watching Netflix. Fun Fact: I can touch the tip of my nose with my tongue. Also, another fun fact: One of my new years resolution is to exercise more this year, so here's to a healthier 2020!
