       <p>I am a Year 2 student studying Industrial Design. I have a pet Bichon Frise named Munchie, who is really the only reason why I have friends. Apart from Munchie, I really love eating, sleeping, baking and watching Netflix. Fun Fact: I can touch the tip of my nose with my tongue. Also, another fun fact: One of my new years resolution is to exercise more this year, so here's to a healthier 2020!</p>
    
       <h2>My strengths as a designer are:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Being meticulous. I pay attention to the small details when designing, which I think is important during any design process.</li>
          <li>Doing research. This allows me to design more accurately for the project that I am working on.</li>
          <li>Having empathy. I am able to understand my targets users, and this enables me to meet their needs better.</li>
          <li>I am efficient.</li>
        </ul>
